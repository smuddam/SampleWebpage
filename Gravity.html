Compared to other styles of bicycle, Gravity bicycles share common features: <br>

The tires are narrow, high-pressure (>=100 psi), and smooth to decrease rolling resistance.<br>
They usually use derailleur gears; however, single-speed and fixed-gear varieties exist.<br>
The bicycle is of a heavyweight construction which ultimately helps in fat reduction. <br><br>

<B>Note:</B>Not recommended for the age above 50 years.
