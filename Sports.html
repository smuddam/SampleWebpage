<h4>Sports Bike: </h4>
<h5>
The term Sports bicycle is used to describe bicycles built for traveling at speed on dirt roads. Some sources use the term to mean racing bicycle. Other sources specifically exclude racing bicycles from the definition, using the term to mean a bicycle of a similar style but built more for endurance and less the fast bursts of speed desired in a racing bicycle; as such, they usually have more gear combinations and fewer hi-tech racing features. Certain of these bicycles have been referred to as 'sportive' bicycles to distinguish them from racing bicycles.

Compared to other styles of bicycle, road bicycles share common features: <br>

The tires are narrow, high-pressure (>=100 psi), and smooth to decrease rolling resistance.<br>
They usually use derailleur gears; however, single-speed and fixed-gear varieties exist.<br>
The bicycle is of a lightweight construction.
